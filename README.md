# export-to-csv | Export to CSV Mini Library

Small, simple, and single purpose. Zero dependencies, functionally inspired, and fairly well-typed.

If you're looking for a fully CSV-compliant, consistently maintained, whole-package library, I'd recommend looking elsewhere! (see [alternatives](#alternatives) section below)

If you want a lightweight, stable, easy-to-use basic CSV generation and download library, feel free to install.

## Installation

```javascript
npm install --save export-to-csv
```

## Usage

This library was written with TypeScript in mind, so the examples will be in TS.

You can easily use this library in JavaScript as well. The bundle is using ES6 modules, which all modern browsers support.

You can also look at the [integration tests](integration/index.html) for browser/JS use, and the [unit tests](lib/__specs__) to understand how the library functions.

### In-browser

```typescript
import { mkConfig, generateCsv, download } from "export-to-csv";

// mkConfig merges your options with the defaults
// and returns WithDefaults<ConfigOptions>
const csvConfig = mkConfig({ useKeysAsHeaders: true });

const mockData = [
  {
    name: "Rouky",
    date: "2023-09-01",
    percentage: 0.4,
    quoted: '"Pickles"',
  },
  {
    name: "Keiko",
    date: "2023-09-01",
    percentage: 0.9,
    quoted: '"Cactus"',
  },
];

// Converts your Array<Object> to a CsvOutput string based on the configs
const csv = generateCsv(csvConfig)(mockData);

// Get the button in your HTML
const csvBtn = document.querySelector("#csv");

// Add a click handler that will run the `download` function.
// `download` takes `csvConfig` and the generated `CsvOutput`
// from `generateCsv`.
csvBtn.addEventListener("click", () => download(csvConfig)(csv));
```

### Node.js

```typescript
import { mkConfig, generateCsv, asString } from "export-to-csv";
import { writeFile } from "node:fs";
import { Buffer } from "node:buffer";

// mkConfig merges your options with the defaults
// and returns WithDefaults<ConfigOptions>
const csvConfig = mkConfig({ useKeysAsHeaders: true });

const mockData = [
  {
    name: "Rouky",
    date: "2023-09-01",
    percentage: 0.4,
    quoted: '"Pickles"',
  },
  {
    name: "Keiko",
    date: "2023-09-01",
    percentage: 0.9,
    quoted: '"Cactus"',
  },
];

// Converts your Array<Object> to a CsvOutput string based on the configs
const csv = generateCsv(csvConfig)(mockData);
const filename = `${csvConfig.filename}.csv`;
const csvBuffer = new Uint8Array(Buffer.from(asString(csv)));

// Write the csv file to disk
writeFile(filename, csvBuffer, (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log("file saved: ", filename);
});
```

# Alternatives

As mentioned above, this library is intentionally small and was designed to solve a very simple need. It **was not** originally designed to be fully CSV compliant, so many things you need _might_ be missing. I'm also not the most active on it (~7 year gap between updates). So, here are some alternatives with more support and that might be more fully featured.
